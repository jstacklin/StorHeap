# StorHeap
Technology is moving, changing, and evolving. What if there was an ability to  store files, games, and applications on a drive that wasnâ€™t yours and be able to  access them in real time?

The Short:
* Online Storage that acts and looks like a hard drive to Windows, Mac and Linux and is fast enough to access any file, application, or folder to be near "real-time"
* Not based on any other crypto-currency and doesn't have a "value" per se
* Payments are done through PayPal or Bitcoin
* Roadmaped until mid 2020
* Open Sourced under the GNU AGPL 3+ License

The GitHub is Active and looking for coders. Please contact us for information on how to help!

# FAQ's:
* What information do we get?
  * StorHeap will only receive information as to where your information is stored in a cookie-crumb style. For example, if the first part of a file you want is stored on Master Node 6j, we will keep the positional data that will help guide the StorHeap client to being able to rebuild in near real-time your file(s)
* What happens if I lose my key?
  * Sadly for security sake we will not be able to backup or restore your key and all data will be lost for your account. For this reason we recommend taking periodical backups of all the data stored in your account to a local hard drive or external hard drive solution to reduce the risk of loss of data. Your key is how you unlock your account and allow access to the nodes to connect back to you. This meaning that if you lose your key, have us reset your key, or your key becomes illegible you will not have access to your data. 
* If I forget or lose my key, what happens to my data?
  * All backed up data related to your key will be removed after 120 days of your keys not being accessed. This is to prevent data pileup on old accounts. Free users will have their data removed after 30 days.
* What is an "Open-Sourced Business"?
  * We currently are operating under an "invite-only" business model to prevent ideas from clashing and the end goal of getting a project that all customers will love. For us, the OS business model allows us to import many ideas and ideals rather than allowing only one envisionary or the person with the deepest pockets to allow all decisions. We are working slowly to get more and more contributors to the project that would allow for multiple people working on different parts of the whole project to lead to the eventuality of only one app for desktop users and then apps for iOS and Android.
  
# Team Signatures:
* Joseph Stacklin, Founder and Designer of StorHeap Technologies - JMS  
  
# Updates! 
* 24 July 2017 - Official Launch and unveil of the website (located here: https://storheap.com) and finally set up the emails so that we can finally get emails from clients and developers (sorry this took so long). I want to re-iterate that the OhioiProject Technologies Group does not own, work with, or fund StorHeap Technologies. We are our own company and we will continue to be so until such a time where we cannot work on our own or another company is to purchase us. We will inform all users should we ever become incorperated in such a way that would change the source code, the License of our source code, or our business model. Many thanks to all those who are currently working with us to make the lauch successful. -JMS
