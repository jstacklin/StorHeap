# StorHeap
Technology is moving, changing, and evolving. What if there was an ability to  store files, games, and applications on a drive that wasn’t yours and be able to  access them in real time?

The Short:
* Online Storage that acts and looks like a hard drive to Windows, Mac and Linux and is fast enough to access any file, application, or folder to be near "real-time"
* Not based on any other crypto-currency and doesn't have a "value" per se
* Payments are done through PayPal or Bitcoin
* Roadmaped until mid 2020
* Open Sourced under the GNU AGPL 3+ License
